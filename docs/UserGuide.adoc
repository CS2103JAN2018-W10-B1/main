== Introduction

SmartSplit is a desktop app for managing share expenses between your contacts*. More importantly, SmartSplit is *optimized for those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface* (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, SmartSplit can get your shared expense management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps. Interested? Jump to the <<Quick Start>> to get started. Enjoy!

== Quick Start

.  Ensure you have Java version `1.8.0_60` or later installed in your Computer.

[NOTE]
Having any Java 8 version is not enough. +
This app will not work with earlier versions of Java 8.
+
.  Download the latest `smartsplit.jar` link:{repoURL}/releases[here].
.  Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for your SmartSplit app.
.  Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI should appear in a few seconds.
